# The Original Prompt

Below is the exact prompt that was used to generate this tutorial with Claude:

```
I'm looking to create a 0 to 1 tutorial, in Markdown format, which explains to people new to building software, the steps they can take to create something. I want the tutorial to be in markdown format, and will deploy it and host it on github pages. It should contain the following content:

1 hour version (Portfolio)
* Creating a Github account
* Creating a Git repo
* Pulling the repo locally
* Using VSCode / cursor to open
* Creating and editing a markdown file
* Upload to github pages
* Set Github pages URL

6 hour version (Web app)
* Draw out the UI on excalidraw
* Extend to be a NextJS / React native template
* Use AI tools with copy-paste technique (e.g. Claude, ChatGPT)
* Getting a ShadCN design
* Creating a .env file
* (Optional) Set up Supabase for auth and login page
* Push to Vercel
* Buy a domain from DNSSimple
